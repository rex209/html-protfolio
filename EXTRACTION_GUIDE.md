# 📁 File Extraction Guide

This guide explains how to extract all the project files from your `all-files.txt` document.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Method 1: Using Node.js Script (Recommended)

1. **Make sure you have Node.js installed** (download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org))

2. **Place your `all-files.txt` in the same directory** as the extraction script

3. **Run the extraction script:**
   ```bash
   node extract-files.js
   ```

4. **If your file has a different name:**
   ```bash
   node extract-files.js your-filename.txt
   ```

### Method 2: Using Bash Script (Linux/Mac)

1. **Make the script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x extract-files.sh
   ```

2. **Run the extraction:**
   ```bash
   ./extract-files.sh
   ```

3. **If your file has a different name:**
   ```bash
   ./extract-files.sh your-filename.txt
   ```

### Method 3: Manual Extraction

If you prefer to extract files manually:

1. Open your `all-files.txt` file
2. Look for lines that start with `=== FILE: `
3. Copy the content between each file marker
4. Create new files with the specified names and paste the content

## 📋 What Gets Extracted

The extraction will create all these files and directories:
- `package.json` - Project dependencies
- `server.js` - Main server file
- `models/` - Database models
- `routes/` - API routes
- `public/` - Frontend files
- `utils/` - Helper functions
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts
- `.env.example` - Environment template
- And many more...

## 🎯 After Extraction

Once extraction is complete:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual values
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   # Demo mode (recommended for testing)
   npm run demo
   
   # Production mode
   npm start
   ```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "File not found" Error
- Make sure `all-files.txt` is in the same directory as the extraction script
- Check the filename spelling

### "Permission denied" Error
- Run: `chmod +x extract-files.sh`
- Or use the Node.js version instead

### "Node.js not found" Error
- Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- Restart your terminal after installation

## 📞 Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that your `all-files.txt` has the correct format (starts with `=== FILE: `)
2. Make sure you're in the right directory
3. Try both extraction methods
4. Check file permissions

Happy coding! 🚀
